<h2>Part II: The Dreams of Pellir</h2>
<br>
<h3>Chapter 11: Doeglin's Sanctum</h3>
<p>The party flees the chaos of Samrum City. The twins lead them to the Old Gate of Doeglin's Sanctum, an ancient abandoned mountainhome that extends far below the Fartop Mountains. Mal stays behind at the makeshift camp where the party heard strange noises the night before, but the rest of the party goes forward. Upon initial investigation, Ned finds traces of the arcane throughout the complex, however there is no sign of the wizard. The party investigates deeper and begins to uncover the history of the complex. Naturally, this investigation leads to treasure hunting when the party breaks open a magical seal on the tomb of the dwarven kings. 
<p>The party inadvertently awakens a tremendous stone golem guarding the hall, as well as a mummified dwarf. The Twins trick the stone golem using the crown of his father, which Han had stolen from inside his golden tomb. The fortress was destroyed by a massive black demon which crawled on the ceiling and swallowed up thousands of dwarves. The party follows a massive blood trail deep into the mountain. After the party decends into the mines, they become lost in a network of tunnels and are forced to set up camp to sleep off their injuries.
<p>Turk explores the mines in a dream. He is hunted by Benevonn, Han explores the mines in a terrible nightmare, but manages to find a mysterious door; this is the door that the wizard went into. They are all stalked by a towering shadowy figure.
<h3> Chapter 12: Encounters with Dreadniah </h3>
<p>The party follows Han's recollections from the dream and finds a tunnel that terminates at a smooth stone doorway. Inside, the door opens up into a great stone chamber of collossal bricks.
